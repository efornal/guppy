Coordinate system that allows integration between different projects.
Each project has a responsibility assigned and is responsible for reporting changes in their projects. When a change for a particular project is added, the system notifies all responsible for projects that are 'integrated' with the project on which the change was applied.
Also, each manager can see notifications about changes applied to different projects and indicate acceptance or disagreement with each change.
This way you can keep track of the various changes affecting projects that make integration and to determine the conformity of the respective responsible.
